IIIF is an emerging standard for publishing and interacting with images.  Brumfield Labs has been working with the IIIF Consortium since 2014, when FromThePage was the first software beyond image viewers to accept IIIF based images.  We've received two commissioned implementation grants from the IIIF Consortium, spoken at the annual IIIF conferences in 2017 and 2018, and spoken on IIIF at the Texas Conference on Digital Libraries (2017, 2018).  We've conducted workshops for the American Art Collaborative and the Visual Resources Association Foundation.  We wrote the [IIIF Implementation Guide](http://iiif.io/assets/acc_implementation_guide_011017.pdf).

We offer in-person IIIF training workshops for institutions or groups.

Here's what former attendees have to say about our IIIF workshop:

*The workshop materials are so comprehensive and amazing. I am looking forward to spending some time with them as our institution moves forward. It is just a wealth of digestible information that will serve to remind and reinforce all of the information that was given in high concentration.*

Attendees at previous workshops have said the most helpful takeaways were:
* *The hands on aspect, creating and editing manifest for example*

* *Playing with the image server, image API and presentation API, hacking URIs and whatnot.*

* *So many implementation and use case ideas! Having five folk in a room talking about IIIF generated a ton of new uses for IIIF I hadn't encountered*

* *Understanding how to introduce IIIF to my institution and learning about the various APIs*

* *Really helpful to talk in person about all of it, with a variety of folks.*

**We can tailor the workshop to your institution's needs.**

If your institution is willing to provide a location, we could also put on a public workshop.  Your attendees would attend at a reduced price and we would publicize the workshop to others in the area.

We can also pair the workshop with IIIF implementation consulting, starting with an implementation questionnaire and creating an institution-specific roadmap.
