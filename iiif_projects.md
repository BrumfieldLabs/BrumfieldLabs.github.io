**AudiAnnotate**
[The AudiAnnotate project](http://hipstas.org/audiannotate/) uses [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) and the [IIIF specifications for AV](https://iiif.io/community/groups/av/) to annotate audio files, and build researcher centered static sites using Jekyll and GitHub to manage editing and publishing IIIF manifests and annotations. 

**SlaveryImages.org** 
Migrated a legacy image collection website to Omeka-S with IIIF support.  Investigated and proposed ways to extend the site to support 3D images and scenes based point cloud data.  Prototyped that plan for the [Annaberg Plantation](http://slaveryimages.org/s/slaveryimages/page/annaberg).

**Consulting and Workshop for the American Art Collaborative**
A implementation consulting engagement and two day workshop for the Dallas Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Crystal Bridges Museum of Art and the Colby College Museum of Art.  As part of the engagement we wrote a [IIIF Implementation Guide](http://iiif.io/assets/acc_implementation_guide_011017.pdf).

**Roundtrip**
FromThePage implements a IIIF based API to provide transcriptions, translations and other annotations back to the library systems documents originate from.  [Read about the API here.](https://github.com/benwbrum/fromthepage/wiki/FromThePage-Support-for-the-IIIF-Presentation-API-and-Web-Annotations)

**FromThePage: Documentary Editing for IIIF**  
Addition of support for the IIIF image protocols to FromThePage, enabling collaborative transcription and annotation of material on any IIIF-enabled repository.

**PontIIIF: Search and Discovery for IIIF Content**  
Creation of a crawler and search engine for content made available in IIIF/JSON-LD.
