**Consulting and Workshop for the American Art Collaborative**
A implementation consulting engagement and two day workshop for the Dallas Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Crystal Bridges Museum of Art and the Colby College Museum of Art.  As part of the engagement we wrote a [IIIF Implementation Guide](http://iiif.io/assets/acc_implementation_guide_011017.pdf).
